## FAQ & Troubleshooting

**Q: How do I access the data?**  
A: Data can be accessed through hheardatacenter.mssm.edu. A description of the registration process is included under "Getting Started".

**Q:I submitted a request for a user account, but I haven't heard back. What should I do?**  
A: Most requests for user accounts are reviewed within 1 week. If you have not received access after one week, please email our support email, listed below, using the email address you used when registering for your HHEAR Data Center account.

**Q: How do I report an issue?**  
A: Send an email to the address below to report any issues with accessing or using the HHEAR Data Repository.

**Q: Are there differences between study-specific data files and the harmonized data?**  
A: Yes. In order to standardize data to the HHEAR ontology, some variables required transformation or may have been excluded from the harmonized dataset. Refer to the "Data Annotations" page for a listing of these differences or email us using the address below and we can discuss any discrepancies.

**Q: How should I cite my use of HHEAR Data?**  
A: Instructions for citing HHEAR Data are included in the [HHEAR Publication Policy.](https://hheardatacenter.mssm.edu/HHEAR-ExternalPublicationsPolicy-2024-09-06_0.pdf) Briefly, all datasets used to create your analytic data should be cited within your bibliography individually. The information needed can be found on the study specific pages within the HHEAR repository and, in the case of harmonized data, within the generated DOI file. In general, citations within a bibliography should follow the following format: 
PI Name. Project Name. Type of Data.Year of Deposition. Repository Name, Access Date. DOI
For example: Christiani D. Relating metals exposure to birth and early childhood outcomes via the metabotype of cord blood. Targeted Lab Analytic Data 2016. HHEAR Data Repository, Accessed 4/24/2024. https://doi.org/10.36043/34_94

**Q: Can I repost HHEAR Data on my own site? Can I share HHEAR Data with colleagues who do not have a HHEAR account?**  
A: No, users are not permitted to repost HHEAR data or share data with unauthorized users. Do not allow others to use your account.

**Q: I am trying to download a customized dataset. The download tracker says 100% but the file is still not available. What should I do?**  
A: The download tracker in the workspace reports on the progress retrieving the data within your query. After it reaches 100%, it still needs to write that data to a file. For large files or slower connections, this may take some time. You do not need to remain on the site for the download to continue.
