## About the HHEAR Data Repository

In 2015, the United States (US) National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) launched the Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource (CHEAR), a groundbreaking initiative focused on spurring exposomic research and advancing our understanding of the role of environmental exposures in children's health research. In 2019, the CHEAR program evolved into the Human Health Exposure Analysis Resource (HHEAR) program expanding its focus beyond childhood to include studies on adulthood. A key achievement of these programs was the establishment of a public data repository, referred to as the HHEAR Data Repository, that contains data from all studies within the CHEAR and HHEAR programs. The repository contains original data files deposited by individual studies and data standardized to a common vocabulary, the HHEAR ontology, to promote data pooling. More information on the HHEAR Data Repository can be found in our [publication.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412025007184?via%3Dihub)
